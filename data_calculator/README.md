1) enter month and the program should display the average temperature for that month.
2) enter month and the program should display the average relative humidity for that month.
3) enter month and the program should display the average absolute humidity temperature for that month.
4) enter a valid date and time. The program should then display the temperature, and relative humidity at that date and time.
5) enter the month and the program should display the highest temperature for that month.
6) enter the month and the program should display the highest relative humidity value for that month.
7) enter the month and the program should display the highest absolute humidity for that month.
8) enter the month and the program should display the dates and times for a month when the temperature is higher than the average temperature for that month along with values of the temperature.
9) enter the month and the program should display the dates and times for a month when the relative humidity is higher than the average relative humidity for that month along with values of the relative humidity.
10) enter the month and the program should display the dates and times for a month when the absolute humidity is higher than the average absolute humidity for that month along with values of the absolute humidity.
